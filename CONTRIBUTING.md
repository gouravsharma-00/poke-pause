# Contributing to Poké-Pause

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome **all contributions**, big or small.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Open a new issue on GitHub if you find a bug or want to suggest a feature.
- Please provide a clear description and steps to reproduce (if applicable).

### Submitting Code
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add feature"`
5. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature-name`
6. Open a Pull Request and explain your changes.

### Coding Guidelines 
- Keep function and variable names descriptive.  
- Comment your code where necessary.  
- **Use TypeScript** for type safety whenever possible.  
- Declare types and interfaces in separate files if your project has many, to keep code organized.  
- Follow a consistent **file and folder structure**.  
- Keep functions **small and focused**; one function should do one thing.  
- Write **clean, readable code**—avoid overly complex one-liners.  
- Use **meaningful commit messages**, e.g., `feat: add random Pokémon API call` or `fix: typo in popup`.  
- **Avoid hardcoding values**; use constants or configuration files.  
- Ensure your **code passes linting and formatting rules** (if using ESLint/Prettier).  
- Write **unit tests** for important functions, if possible.  
- **Respect existing patterns** in the codebase; consistency matters more than personal preference.  
- Remove any **console.log or debugging code** before committing.
